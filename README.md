# C-game/Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-tac-toe made with help of C-Programming language.Nothing fancy a small console program to ask user where they want to place their input i.e X or O.

First we create a place hodler variable which contains the places where the user is allowed to puts thier input. 

<br />1 | 2 | 3 <br />
<br />4 | 5 | 6 <br />
<br />7 | 8 | 9 <br />


For the board we just make a simple board using the printf function nothing to complex there.

<br />1 | 2 | 3 <br />
<br />- | - | - <br />
<br />4 | 5 | 6 <br />
<br />- | - | - <br />
<br />7 | 8 | 9 <br />

Now we need to know what is going on with the board to check weather some one has won the game, an invalid move or if the game is still on or not.
To check we have to set different if conditions to check the placeholders weather the user playing has won the game or not.
